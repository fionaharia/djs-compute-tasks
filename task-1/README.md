You're building a website for a coffee shop. They have a promotion where they
offer a discount on coffee based on the quantity ordered.
Write a JavaScript function that takes the quantity of coffee bags as an
argument and calculates the total cost after applying the discount rules:
    ● If the quantity is less than 5, there's no discount.
    ● If the quantity is between 5 and 10 (both inclusive), apply a 10% discount.
    ● If the quantity is more than 10, apply a 20% discount.
    ● The price per bag of coffee is $10.
Write the JavaScript function that calculates and returns the total cost after
applying the appropriate discount.
